            Biography:</br></br>

            Josh Pond is a software developer and data analyst who works with the Polarized Target Group at UVA to study resonance decays in accelerator experiments.
            After working in nuclear physics for more than 3 years, probably more than a billion events have passed through his programs to be analyzed.</br>

            Josh takes great pride in the work he does. Creating programs that are useful to people, like the ones that take millions of data points and turn them into something meaningful, is an art form he hopes to perfect.</br>

            Josh has contributed to the PyPWA Python partial wave analysis toolkit, as well as several scientific papers.</br>

            Josh holds a BS in Physics from the University of Virginia.</br>

            Josh finds writing in the third person uncomfortable.
