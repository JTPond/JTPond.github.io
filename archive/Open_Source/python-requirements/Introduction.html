<h1>python-requirements</h1>
<p>I'm really not a fan of IDEs, I always feel like they're in my way and telling me what to do, so I usually opt for a plain text editor. VIM and GEdit are good enough most of the time, but when working on large projects, or when I'm at work (a MS Windows shop), I really like Atom. It does the best job of staying out of my way, and doing stuff that I don't like to worry about, like keeping git repos up to date.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wrote a simple plugin for scraping a Python project and producing a requirements.txt file for you. It's gone through a couple releases now and has more than 7300 downloads at the time of writing and you can find it <a href="https://atom.io/packages/python-requirements">here</a> if that sounds valuable to you.</p>
