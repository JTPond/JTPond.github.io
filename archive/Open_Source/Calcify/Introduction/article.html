<h1>Calcify</h1>
<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/calcify">Calcify</a> is the main reason we're here. I started writing Calcify over a year ago when I went to write a Universe in a Box simulation in Rust and was unhappy with the state of linear algebra crates. There was nothing <em>wrong</em> with any of the crates at the time, like nalgebra, but because they were trying to be like Numpy they ended up fighting the Rust type system. Well, I was doing physics, so a 3D vector was all I needed and the idea of Calcify was born.</p>
<p>Calcify will probably play some role in just about everything you read about here, and its development will follow as new features are needed for different experiments. In general you can expect realease notes in this folder, and maybe talks about possible features.</p>
