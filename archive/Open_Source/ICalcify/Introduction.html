<h1>ICalcify</h1>
<p>ICalcify is the interactive analysis arm of the Calcify crate. With the Rust part devoted to simulation and calculations, it was natural to write the analysis piece in Python. ICalcify is able to read all Trees and FeedTrees written to disk in Calcify, in both json and MessagePack format, and interactivly browse through them and has some simple analysis tools built in, like plotting with matplotlib, and fitting using scipy. Mainly it opens the Trees up in an easy to use format in IPython and includes several useful modules for the user to get started as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you're already using Calcify, you can find ICalcify <a href="https://github.com/JTPond/ICalcify">here</a>. Please checkout the readme for examples and usage instructions.</p>
