<h2>A platoform for Dutch Style auctions in Rust</h2>
<p>The goal of which is to allow creators to sell equity in a project in an IPO style auction through a broker, which gives them access to qualified and vetted investors.</p>
<p>The idea for now is for the application, once the auction is completed, to produce a Solidity script to execute the final transfers on the Blockchain.</p>
