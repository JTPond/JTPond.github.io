# An Introduction to What I Mean by Machine Learning

To be up front right from the start, I am not an expert in machine learning of any kind. I have some experience with more simple trainable models, and a bit of time working with neural networks, but I could not tell you what the state of the art is, and I have almost no interest in the heavy NN frameworks like TF and Torch. I'm much more interested in the sorts of toy use cases and experiments that professionals would scoff at. 

But if you like fun experiments and a little silliness, keep an eye out for "Critters", a program I'm working on for playing around with behavior and choice in simple NNs.
