<h1>About This Site</h1>
<p>This site is named for the Rust crate, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/calcify">Calcify</a>, that I wrote and maintain for use in my hobbies. I wrote the toolset this site is built on as an extension of that. You can find the repo for the toolset on GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/JTPond/calcifyarchive">here</a>. It is built in Typescript and the indexer is Python.</p>
