# About This Site

This site is named for the Rust crate, [Calcify](https://crates.io/crates/calcify), that I wrote and maintain for use in my hobbies. I wrote the toolset this site is built on as an extension of that. You can find the repo for the toolset on GitHub, [here](https://github.com/JTPond/calcifyarchive). It is built in Typescript and the indexer is Python.
