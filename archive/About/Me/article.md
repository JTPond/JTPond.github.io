# Greetings!

My name is Josh and I'm a frustrated computational physicist working in finance as a software engineer. I made this site to write longer pieces about my open source work, and experiments that I run in my spare time, that don't belong in READMEs and Docs. I hope you find this work useful. Follow me on [Github!](https://github.com/JTPond) 

## Interests that you can expect to read about
