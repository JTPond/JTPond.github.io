<h1>Experiment 2 - Max Height</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>At the beginning of this project I had trouble settling on a maximum height for colonies. I ended up settling on 4 for the Seed Probability tests, but that was chosen arbitrarily for only two reasons. 1) It felt somewhat <em>natural</em> based on the standard GoL rules and 2) I didn't want to type any more RGB codes than that by hand into the source code for creating the gifs. Anyway, I found <a href="https://coolors.co/gradient-palette/ffffff-031a04?number=30">this site</a> for creating gradient palettes and I was off to the races for finding the ideal max height.</p>
<h2>Fixed Setup</h2>
<p>Board Size: 2000 X 2000</p>
<p>Seed Prob: 40%</p>
<p>Time Steps: 300</p>
<h2>Visual Inspection</h2>
<p>These are a few 500 X 500 crops of the board at all tested heights.</p>

<p>I went with heights that were powers of 2 so that the pallets could stay sane in the code and I appended gold to the end to represent cells of the max height.</p>
<p>I'd like to draw everyone's attention to the 32 plot. Because of the large number of colors in the gradient the edges can be quite soft by comparison and I think they just look so organic, it's a stunning result considering the genesis of this <a href="./#/Simulation/Conways_Bacteria/Introduction">project</a>. Also, 32 had by far the most gold.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In contrast with the look of the gifs, the charts are much more underwhelming.</p>
<h3>Total Height</h3>

<h3>Tallest Colony on the Board</h3>

<p>I'm not sure there's anything interesting to say about these results, other than I guess it's good it behaves the way I expect. The total height of the board does increase with max height, but not in any interesting way; not quite linear, not quite log. And all of them reach their maximums somewhere on the board eventually, only missing the perfect 1:1 slope by a few frames with no increases.</p>
<p>I'm honestly a bit disappointed.</p>
<h2>Future work</h2>
<p>I'm going to be taking a closer look at densities on the board, and try to get a better idea why <code>MAX_HEIGHT=32</code> had so many more gold cells.</p>
